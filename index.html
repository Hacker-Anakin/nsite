    <h1 class="title">Neit Programming Language</h1>

    <p class="content">Welcome to **Neit**, the programming language that’s faster than your morning coffee and smarter than your pet hamster. Whether you're a noob still figuring out semicolons or a battle-hardened coding ninja, Neit is here to save your day. It’s as easy as Python, but as powerful as a robot made from C and Rust, ready to blast through any task with style and speed!</p>
    
    <p class="content">At the heart of Neit lies the **Semigen engine**, which is basically a magic wand for code! It lets you bend the language's syntax to your will. Forget rigid, outdated rules—Neit is like a blank canvas where you can paint your perfect coding masterpiece. Think of it like a genie who grants your every wish... but instead of three wishes, you get infinite code customization. Whether you’re building tiny apps or supercomputers, Neit adapts to YOU, making it feel like the language was created just for your brain!</p>

    <p class="content">But wait, there's more! Neit isn't just customizable—it’s **lightning fast**. We’ve cut out all the unnecessary bloat that other languages try to drag along, leaving you with a lean, mean, coding machine. No more headaches over endless boilerplate code and configuration files—Neit goes straight to the point, making your coding experience feel like an F1 car race (but without the risk of crashing!).</p>

    <p class="content">And here’s where it gets really spicy: Neit has not just one, but a **super-powered compiler**! It churns out clean, high-performance C code, uses Clang for next-level optimizations, and makes your programs run faster than a squirrel on espresso. With Neit, you’re not just a programmer—you’re a code wizard casting spells to make your software go vroom-vroom. Want to tweak some settings or change the speed of your code? Neit makes it so easy, even your pet hamster could do it (if it learned how to read, of course).</p>
    
    <p class="content">Not into wrestling with compilers? No worries—Neit’s got your back with its **Rust-based interpreter**. This baby lets you run Neit code without needing a compiler at all. It’s like having a portable, pocket-sized Neit-runner that fits snugly in your metaphorical pocket. Just fire it up and BAM—you’re ready to run your code like a pro in your own personal secret lair. No need for complex setups or a fancy machine—Neit is quick, portable, and works anywhere, anytime.</p>

    <p class="content">Sure, the interpreter may not be as fast as the Clang-compiled version, but who’s counting? It’s still faster than most languages and we’re constantly improving it. Soon, the interpreter will be so fast you’ll think it’s time-traveling. Whether you’re on your laptop or a spaceship, Neit will always be there, helping you get things done.</p>

    <p class="content">Neit is **built for the future**—we’ve had tea with future programmers (well, maybe just a dream about it) and they told us Neit is the one. Coding isn’t just about typing endless lines of text—it’s about creating tools that make your life easier. With Neit, you get the freedom to craft your perfect coding experience. Need raw speed for an app that might break the speed of light, or just something simple and cute for your weekend project? Neit’s got you covered, no matter the size or scope. It’s all about **choice** and **freedom**, with a sprinkle of magic. And let's face it—coding has never been this fun!</p>

    <p class="content">So, what are you waiting for? Give **Neit** a whirl today, and get ready to experience the next evolution in programming languages. With Neit, you’ll feel like you’re casting powerful spells with every line of code. Speed, power, flexibility—it’s all yours. Welcome to the future of coding. It’s Neit. It’s awesome. It’s ready for you!</p>
    
    <p class="content">Here’s a peek at some of Neit’s syntax—it's so easy, you’ll wonder why you didn’t switch earlier!</p>
    <p class="code">
        print Hello world  # Prints "Hello world!"<br>
        may name = "joy"  # Creates a variable 'name' and sets it to "joy"<br>
        print {name}  # Prints the value of 'name' (which is "joy")<br>
        ## By the way, print outputs on the same line. println adds a new line. Use println for most cases unless you’re doing something special!<br>
        println {name}  # Prints the value of 'name' on a new line<br>
        may age = takein()  # Asks the user for input, defaulting to a string
    </p>
    <p class="content">Now, let’s take things up a notch with an example that asks for your name and greets you! It’s like the program has a personality.</p>
    <p class="code">
        println Hello user! What’s your name?<br>
        print ><br>
        may name = takein()  # Takes input from the user<br>
        println Hello {name}! Welcome to Neit!  # Greets the user by name<br>
    </p>
